This paper introduces a triple graph neural network framework for heterogeneous graph representation learning. By incorporating collaboratively designed multilevel augmentation, the framework enables fine-grained modeling across semantic, structural, and node feature dimensions. Through cross-view and cross-network contrastive learning, it generates node representations with improved discrimination and consistency.
